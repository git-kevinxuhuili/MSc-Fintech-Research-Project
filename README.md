## Abstract

The objective of this thesis is to provide a comparative analysis of various machine learning methods in forecasting cross-sectional US stock returns upon excluding small-cap equities. We adopt four machine learning techniques with increasing complexity, ranging across penalised linear methods that include lasso and elastic net, partial least squares (PLS), feedforward neural network (FNN), and feedforward neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM-FNN). \(R_{oos}^{2}\) and long-only machine learning portfolios are used to assess the predictive accuracy and economic gains for each technique. We also identify influential anomalies for all methods. Furthermore, return predictability of machine learning approaches is evaluated under different market states. Last but not least, we investigate return predictability amid two economic recessions (2001 dot-com bubble and 2008 financial crisis), post 2001 decimalisation and post-financial crisis. The research carried out in this thesis could be used for investment management purposes by asset management firms, investment banks and hedge-funds.
